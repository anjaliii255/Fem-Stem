- Back-end was supported using Node.js
- I used the Youtube Data v3 API for fetching the women made tech tutorials.
- MongoDB database is used to store the registered users and their details as well as the groups and their comments for the mentor/mentee page.
- I used bcrypt.js to hash the passwords in our database to ensure security of out users against any kind of data breach
- I used passport.js to authenticate our users
- I used UserWay plugin to make our web app more accessible to users with visual impairment or other similar issues.
- I used Canva to create our app logo as well as all the designs used on our web page.
- I used Heroku to host our web app.
